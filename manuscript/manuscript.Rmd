A key challenge in adolescence is developing mature emotion regulation abilities [@zimmermannEmotionRegulationEarly2014]. 
Adolescents experience biological, cognitive, and social changes that create an opportunity for positive emotion regulation development [@steinbergAgeOpportunityLessons2014].
Still, as many as 20% of adolescents instead experience severe emotion regulation difficulties [@leeAdolescentMentalHealth2014],
with potentially lifelong implications for mental health and well-being [@aldaoEmotionregulationStrategiesPsychopathology2010].
These difficulties in emotion regulation can cause substantial distress to the individual,
and incur a sizable societal cost.
Researchers thus seek to understand what risk factors predispose some adolescents to emotion dysregulation,
so that effective screening and interventions can be developed.
Despite abundant empirical research, however,
an overarching understanding is still lacking because
the literature is fragmented across subdisciplines 
and lacks consistent terminology and guiding theory [@vanlissaMappingPhenomenaRelevant2021].
  
The present study seeks to gain a more comprehensive understanding of adolescent emotion regulation development by using machine learning methods for rigorous exploration.
<!-- These predictors may include both risk factors that render some youth susceptible to emotion regulation difficulties, and correlates that can be used to identify at-risk youth. -->
The SEM-forests algorithm was used to
identify the most important early indicators of developmental trajectories
of emotion regulation across adolescence, from a large set of potential candidates.
The resulting insights can guide future research and interventions to focus on the most important predictors,
and lays the foundation for formation and revision of overarching theory, such that essential phenomena are adequately represented.

Recently, a text mining systematic review of 6305 publications on adolescents' emotion regulation has revealed what phenomena 

Theory cons methods for theory construction state that the first step in this endeavor is to identify well-established relevant *empirical phenomena*,
defined as stable and general features of the world [@borsboomTheoryConstructionMethodology2020].
The current study used a text mining systematic review to provide a comprehensive map of the empirical phenomena relevant to adolescent emotion regulation.

Currently, few instruments exist for the identification of relevant phenomena; instead, theorists typically rely on expert opinion [@borsboomTheoryConstructionMethodology2020].
This paper argues that systematic reviews are a suitable and relatively more objective method for phenomena detection.
Traditional narrative reviews are limited, however, by small convenience samples,
confirmation bias,
and an undue emphasis on positive results [@littellEvidencebasedBiasedQuality2008].
These limitations are overcome by a novel method:
the text mining systematic review (TMSR).
Relative to narrative reviews, text mining can cover arbitrarily greater corpora,
and gleans insights from the literature by means of a relatively more transparent, objective, and reproducible process.
<!--Where sentient readers tend to structure their reading of the literature around established ideas [@littellEvidencebasedBiasedQuality2008],
the inherent "fairness" of text mining gives emerging themes a chance to come to the fore.-->
This approach assumes the frequency with which phenomena recur in the literature to be indicative of their relevance.
If it is additionally assumed that the frequency with which phenomena are studied together is indicative of the extent to which they are thought to be associated,
then the co-occurrence of phenomena within publications can be interpreted as a rudimentary nomological network: a mapping of relationships between theoretically relevant phenomena [see @alaviAligningTheoryMethodology2018].
Such a network can serve as a starting point for the formulation of a proto-theory,
which would additionally involve abductive reasoning: specifying putative mechanisms to explain associations between the phenomena [@borsboomTheoryConstructionMethodology2020].
Text mining systematic reviews constitute an inductive and exploratory approach:
Their aim is phenomena detection based on generalization from observations (data) without appeal to theory [@haigExploratoryFactorAnalysis2005].
By identifying and mapping the phenomena relevant to adolescent emotion regulation,
such an inductive approach lays the groundwork for future theory development.

Where sentient readers tend to structure their reading of the literature around established ideas [@littellEvidencebasedBiasedQuality2008],
This potentially reveals phenomena and associations missed by narrative reviewers,
thereby laying the groundwork for future empirical and theoretical work.


we set out to map these relevant empirical phenomena using a systematic review.

We discuss how this nomological network relates to existing relevant theory, and conclude
with recommendations for future theory-generating efforts.
There have been calls for the  consolidation of these disparate insights into overarching theory would be an important step forward.
An important first step 
and intrinsic limitations of narrative reviews prohibit comprehensive coverage of the vast but diffuse literature .-->

Recent years have seen the publication of several excellent systematic reviews,
but these have all been narrative reviews.-->

<!-- SH: this implies that the main contribution of the paper is predominantly methodological is that the case? Is there some primary thesis/argument that will be advanced? It is really important to take a top-down approach to that messaging, beginning here in the first paragraph-->

there are several *relevant* theories, there is no specific theoretical
framework to guide research on adolescents' emotion regulation. Although theory
development is beyond the scope of this paper, we set out to generate a

## Knowledge gap

Substantial empirical research, but:

* Different (sub)disciplines have approached the topic in disparate ways [@riedigerEmotionRegulationAdolescence2014]
* No consistent terminology [@bariolaChildAdolescentEmotion2011]
* No conceptual frameworks [@stifterEmotionRegulation2019]
* No overarching theoretical framework [@bussTheoriesEmotionalDevelopment2019]

Knowledge must be consolidated into overarching theory

## Relevant theory

* Bioecological model [@bronfenbrennerBioecologicalModelHuman2007]
* Transactional model [@sameroffUnifiedTheoryDevelopment2010]
* Hall's notion of "storm and stress"
* Theory of normative emotional development [@sroufeEmotionalDevelopmentOrganization1995]
* Tripartite model [@morrisRoleFamilyContext2007]
* Internalization model [@holodynskiDevelopmentEmotionsEmotion2006]
* Polyvagal theory [@porgesOrientingDefensiveWorld1995].
* Model of social-affective engagement and goal flexibility [@croneUnderstandingAdolescencePeriod2012]
* Process model of emotion regulation [@grossHandbookEmotionRegulation2013]
* Social Information Processing Theory [@lemeriseIntegratedModelEmotion2000]

## Limitations of relevant theory

* Few explicitly address adolescence
* Few comprehensively address predictors of emotion regulation
* None directly guide contemporary research 
* Theories vary widely in scope: Some are broad and non-specific; others describe a specific phenomenon in detail, but lack a broader perspective.
    + Broad theories can frame any research, specific theories generate hypotheses.
    + It would be beneficial to bridge these levels of analysis.

## Towards integrative theory

First step: identifying relevant phenomena [@borsboomTheoryConstructionMethodology2020]

We conducted a text mining systematic review (TMSR) [@vanlissaMappingPhenomenaRelevant2021]

  * Narrative reviews: small samples, confirmation bias, emphasize positive results [@littellEvidencebasedBiasedQuality2008]
  * TMSR: Unlimited sample size, transparent, objective, reproducible

## Present study

RQ1: What are the most important predictors of adolescents' trajectories of emotion regulation development?

RQ2: What is the nature of the association of the predictors with the trajectories?

**Participants**

* RADAR data (https://www.uu.nl/en/research/radar)
* 497 Dutch adolescents (283 boys; age at T1: M =13.03, SD = 0.46)
* Collected between 2006-2011
* Most families were  medium- to high-SES (10% low-SES)

## Candidate predictors

Predictors: 87

Categories: 

* Demographics (e.g., SES)
* Biological (age, sex, pubertal development)
* Individual differences (big5, BIS/BAS, empathy)
* Risk behavior (in/externalizing symptoms, substance use, delinquency, school performance, victimization)
* Relationship quality (parents/peers)
* Parenting (perceived and parent-reported)
* Conflict resolution styles

## Dependent variable

Difficulties in emotion regulation [@gratzMultidimensionalAssessmentEmotion2004]

* 24 items (omitted 'emotional awareness' subscale)
* E.g.: “When I’m upset, I have difficulty thinking about anything else”
* 1 (“Almost never”) to 5 (“Almost always”)
* Excellent reliability, $(.94 > \alpha > .95)$.
* Metric invariance across waves
* Quadratic growth model had good fit

## Summary

Important:

* Best predictors: Personality and related constructs
* Best parental predictor is autonomy support (bal. rel.)
  + Negative/intrusive parenting more predictive than other positive practices
* Conflict frequency and behavior
* Empathy, particularly personal distress

Less important than expected:

* SES
* Bullying/victimization
* Delinquency
* Substance use
* Monitoring

## Reflection content

* Most important predictors are routinely assessed (big 5) or overt (conflict)
  + Prime candidates for early risk assessment
  + Conflict resolution behavior can be taught
    - Target for intervention if association is causal
* Emphasis on parenting (in literature and theory) might not be justified
  + Congruent with RI-CLPM showing few parenting effects in adolescence [@vanlissaRoleFathersMothers2019]
* Order of predictors mirrors bioecological model

## {.fullslide}

![](polarplot2.png)

## Reflections form

* Many predictors show non-linear effects: Emotion dysregulation only for +/-1SD
* Some predictors show almost no marginal effect (e.g., father's age, drug use)
  + This suggests they might be important in **interactions**

## Limitations

* Selective sample
  + WEIRD, Dutch, mostly mid- high-SES (restriction of range)
* Panel study, so few biological / cognitive / neurological measures
* Relatively small sample size
  + If you have access to 1000+ sample, please get in touch
* Computational constraints prevented us from tuning the model beyond default settings, and from exploring marginal effects for higher order interactions

## Conclusions

* Proximal factors more predictive of ER development than distal predictors
* Parenting may be less relevant than previously thought
* Personality and conflict behavior are candidates for early diagnosis
* Conflict skills training might be avenue for intervention
