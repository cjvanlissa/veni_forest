  abstract = {Preanalysis plans (PAPs) have become an important tool for limiting false discoveries in field experiments. We evaluate the properties of an alternate approach which splits the data into two samples: An exploratory sample and a confirmation sample. When hypotheses are homogeneous, we describe an improved split-sample approach that achieves 90\% of the rejections of the optimal PAP without requiring preregistration or constraints on specification search in the exploratory sample. When hypotheses are heterogeneous in priors or intrinsic interest, we find that a hybrid approach which prespecifies hypotheses with high weights and priors and uses a split-sample approach to test additional hypotheses can have power gains over any pure PAP. We assess this approach using the community-driven development (CDD) application from Casey et al. (2012) and find that the use of a hybrid split-sample approach would have generated qualitatively different conclusions.},

  abstract = {Emotion regulation is a key challenge of early childhood. The present study examined emotion regulation behaviour longitudinally from infancy to preschool. The continuity of emotion regulation was explored within the larger ecological context of maternal childhood histories of aggression and social withdrawal and maternal use of constructive and non-constructive behaviours. Forty-five mothers with childhood histories of aggression or social withdrawal from the Concordia Longitudinal Risk Project, a prospective, longitudinal, intergenerational study, participated with their preschool children. Infants' emotion regulation behaviour was observed during interactions with their mothers when they were 5{$\frac{1}{2}$} months of age. Emotion regulation in these same children as preschoolers was coded during an interference task using the Preschooler Self-Regulatory Scheme. Longitudinal findings demonstrated continuity in children's use of emotion regulation behaviours from infancy to preschool. Higher maternal childhood histories of risk, specifically social withdrawal, contributed to the prediction of preschoolers' increased attention-seeking behaviours. Mothers' use of non-constructive verbalizations predicted more maladaptive styles of emotion regulation in their preschoolers. The findings highlight the importance of helping children develop adaptive emotion regulation skills from a young age and have implications for the design of preventive intervention programmes to help parents foster children's emotion regulation abilities.

Included are considerations regarding theoretical, methodological, and sampling strengths and weaknesses of existing literature. On the basis of the review, several directions for future research are proposed. First, it is argued that consistency in the measurement of emotion regulation is necessary, including assessment of more refined theoretical conceptualizations of regulatory types, skills, or strategies. Second, it is argued that emotion regulation developmental research examining the post-early childhood period is necessary in order to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of youths' emotion regulation. Finally, it is argued that greater examination of paternal influences on child emotional functioning, in addition to maternal influences, is required. Consideration of these issues in future emotion regulation research will ideally contribute to a greater understanding of the mechanisms involved in child and adolescent development of optimal regulatory capacities.},

Evidence consistent with the proposition that individuals differ in plasticity is reviewed. The authors document multiple instances in which (a) phenotypic temperamental characteristics, (b) endophenotypic attributes, and (c) specific genes function less like "vulnerability factors" and more like "plasticity factors," thereby rendering some individuals more malleable or susceptible than others to both negative and positive environmental influences. Discussion focuses upon limits of the evidence, statistical criteria for distinguishing differential susceptibility from diathesis stress, potential mechanisms of influence, and unknowns in the differential-susceptibility equation.},

We also investigated whether certain emotion regulation strategies can be detected through different forms of symptom clusters. Study 1 includes 432 school aged non-referred youngsters (60 \% girls; age range between 8 and 18 years) and Study 2 includes 128 school aged non-referred youngsters (55 \% girls; age range between 10 and 14 years). A self-report questionnaire, FEEL-KJ investigates a wide range of adaptive and maladaptive ER strategies. DSM symptom clusters (affective, anxiety, somatic, conduct, oppositional and ADHD problems) were measured by parent report on the Child Behaviour Checklist; depressive symptoms were measured with the Child Depression Inventory. Youngsters with emotional problems have specifically less adaptive ER strategies. The relation with maladaptive ER strategies can only be detected with self-reported depressive symptoms. ER strategies problem-oriented action and acceptance are transdiagnostically related to both internalizing and externalizing problems. For affective, somatic, conduct and ADHD problems the ER-specificity hypothesis is confirmed. Investigating ER strategies could be of clinical relevance specifically in children with affective, somatic, conduct and ADHD problems. Next, training deficits in the ER strategies Problem-oriented action and Acceptance can be considered as important in the treatment of all children with emotional problems.},

With respect to a hypothesized model of multivariate outcomes, such trees recursively find subgroups with similar patterns of observed data. SEM trees allow for the automatic selection of variables that predict differences across individuals in specific theoretical models, for instance, differences in latent factor profiles or developmental trajectories. However, SEM trees are unstable when small variations in the data can result in different trees. As a remedy, SEM forests, which are ensembles of SEM trees based on resamplings of the original dataset, provide increased stability. Because large forests are less suitable for visual inspection and interpretation, aggregate measures provide researchers with hints on how to improve their models: (a) variable importance is based on random permutations of the out-of-bag (OOB) samples of the individual trees and quantifies, for each variable, the average reduction of uncertainty about the model-predicted distribution; and (b) case proximity enables researchers to perform clustering and outlier detection. We provide an overview of SEM forests and illustrate their utility in the context of cross-sectional factor models of intelligence and episodic memory. We discuss benefits and limitations, and provide advice on how and when to use SEM trees and forests in future research.},

For attachment avoidance, associations with ER strategies seem to depend on the specific type of emotion involved, whereas attachment anxiety related to dysregulation irrespective of the type of emotions. Furthermore, Study 2 found that attachment anxiety and avoidance are associated with internalizing and externalizing problems via different ER strategies. Discussion focuses on the dynamics involved in associations between attachment, ER, and psychological problems.},

The new model is not a paradigm shift, but rather represents a transition from a focus on the environment to a focus on proximal processes as engines of development. We begin with the defining properties of the model, which involves four principal components (process, person, context, and time), and the dynamic, interactive relationships among them. We then turn to the research designs required for testing the model. In doing so, we not only present the next stage in the evolution of an ecological theory of human development, but we also document the requirements for conducting developmental research in the discovery mode.

Here we formalize the notion of instability and derive theoretical results to analyze the variance reduction effect of bagging (or variants thereof) in mainly hard decision problems, which include estimation after testing in regression and decision trees for regression functions and classifiers. Hard decisions create instability, and bagging is shown to smooth such hard decisions, yielding smaller variance and mean squared error. With theoretical explanations, we motivate subagging based on subsampling as an alternative aggregation scheme. It is computationally cheaper but still shows approximately the same accuracy as bagging. Moreover, our theory reveals improvements in first order and in line with simulation studies. In particular, we obtain an asymptotic limiting distribution at the cube-root rate for the split point when fitting piecewise constant functions. Denoting sample size by n, it follows that in a cylindric neighborhood of diameter n-1/3 of the theoretically optimal split point, the variance and mean squared error reduction of subagging can be characterized analytically. Because of the slow rate, our reasoning also provides an explanation on the global scale for the whole covariate space in a decision tree with finitely many splits.}

Traditional neurobiological and cognitive explanations for such suboptimal choices and actions have failed to account for nonlinear changes in behavior observed during adolescence, relative to childhood and adulthood. This review provides a biologically plausible conceptualization of the mechanisms underlying these nonlinear changes in behavior, as an imbalance between a heightened sensitivity to motivational cues and immature cognitive control. Recent human imaging and animal studies provide a biological basis for this view, suggesting differential development of subcortical limbic systems relative to top-down control systems during adolescence relative to childhood and adulthood. This work emphasizes the importance of examining transitions into and out of adolescence and highlights emerging avenues of future research on adolescent brain development.}

  abstract = {Dysfunctional emotion regulation is an important predictor of psychopathology. Although many clinical programs focus on emotion regulation skills, the successful application of these programs in children and adolescents requires knowledge on the normative use of emotion regulation strategies over age. To this end, the current cross-sectional study examined changes in emotion regulation throughout childhood and adolescence. The use of seven adaptive and five maladaptive emotion regulation strategies was measured with the FEEL-KJ in a representative sample (N = 1397) of Dutch children and adolescents between 8 and 18 years old. Overall, the results indicated reduced use of adaptive strategies and increased use of maladaptive strategies in participants between 12 and 15 years old compared with younger or older participants. The findings of the current study indicate that adolescence is characterized by a maladaptive shift in emotion regulation. Given that the continued use of dysfunctional emotion regulation plays an important role in the development and maintenance of psychopathology, these results highlight the importance of prevention and treatment programs focused on emotion regulation to shield vulnerable adolescents against mental illness.},

  abstract = {Reliance on disengagement strategies to manage emotional experiences is associated with higher levels of mental health symptomology. Nascent research suggests, however, that socioeconomic status (SES) may moderate the associations between emotion regulation (ER) strategy use and mental health problems. A handful of studies have been conducted assessing moderators of ER and mental health, but few have examined disengagement and all are cross-sectional. As such, little is known about whether SES influences the association between disengagement use and mental health or whether these associations vary across developmental period. The current study, therefore, examined whether the efficacy of ER during the transition from early adolescence to adulthood is moderated by SES. Participants (n = 341) who were part of a larger, longitudinal study were assessed during early adolescence (Mage = 13), late adolescence (Mage = 17), and adulthood (Mage = 24). SES moderated the association between disengagement use and internalizing symptoms during early adolescence and adulthood, but not late adolescence. SES also moderated the association between disengagement use and externalizing symptoms, but only during early adolescence. In each case the significant adverse association between disengagement and mental health was amplified among those from lower SES backgrounds.

Thus, little is known about how patterns in the repertoires of ER strategies are associated with different mental disorders. We utilised latent class analysis to identify distinct repertoires of ER strategies, and their links with various psychopathology domains (i.e., anxiety, depression, disordered eating, borderline personality). Participants (N = 531) reported on their use of seven ER strategies in six recalled stressful contexts, as well as on their symptoms of psychopathology. We identified five classes of ER strategies: Low Regulators (n = 168), High Regulators (n = 140), Adaptive Regulators (n = 99), Worriers/Ruminators (n = 96) and Avoiders (n = 28). Generally, High Regulators and Worriers/Ruminators endorsed greater levels of psychopathology, relative to Low and Adaptive Regulators. Our findings underscore the importance of characterising the dynamics of ER repertoires when seeking to understand links between ER strategies and psychopathology.},

Unfortunately, researchers who attempt to do both on the same data set run the risk of making false discoveries, even when testing and exploration are carried out on distinct subsets of data. Based on ideas drawn from differential privacy, Dwork et al. now provide a theoretical solution. Ideas are tested against aggregate information, whereas individual data set components remain confidential. Preserving that privacy also preserves statistical inference validity. Science, this issue p. 636 Misapplication of statistical data analysis is a common cause of spurious discoveries in scientific research. Existing approaches to ensuring the validity of inferences drawn from data assume a fixed procedure to be performed, selected before the data are examined. In common practice, however, data analysis is an intrinsically adaptive process, with new analyses generated on the basis of data exploration, as well as the results of previous analyses on the same data. We demonstrate a new approach for addressing the challenges of adaptivity based on insights from privacy-preserving data analysis. As an application, we show how to safely reuse a holdout data set many times to validate the results of adaptively chosen analyses. A statistical approach allows large data sets to be reanalyzed to test new hypotheses. A statistical approach allows large data sets to be reanalyzed to test new hypotheses.},

Researchers perform their analysis on the training sample and are able to incorporate feedback from both colleagues, editors and referees. Once the paper is accepted for publication the method is applied to the testing sample and it is those results that are published. Simulations indicate that, under empirically relevant settings, the proposed method delivers more power than a pre-analysis plan. The effect mostly operate through a lower likelihood that relevant hypotheses are left untested. The method appears better suited for exploratory analyses where there is significant uncertainty about the outcomes of interest. We do not recommend using the method in situations where the treatment are very costly and thus the available sample size is limited. An interpretation of the method is that it allows researchers to perform direct replication of their work. We also discuss a number of practical issues about the method's feasibility and implementation.},

This increased attention to peer evaluation has implications for emotion regulation in adolescence, but little is known about the characteristics of the evaluatee and evaluator that influence emotional reactions to evaluative outcomes. The present study used a computer-based social evaluation task to examine predictors of adolescents' emotional responses to feedback from unknown peers. Nine-to-seventeen-year-olds (N = 36) completed the ``chatroom task'' and indicated the degree to which each peer would be interested in interacting with them and how good they felt after receiving acceptance and rejection feedback from peers. We examined whether adolescents' age and gender impacted their emotional responses to being accepted or rejected by peers of different age groups (i.e., early or middle adolescence) and genders. We also tested whether expectations about peers' interest was associated with variability in adolescents' emotional responses to the evaluative outcome. Upon being accepted by middle adolescent male peers, females in the middle relative to early years of adolescence reported greater well-being, whereas males reported similar levels of well-being regardless of their own age. Following acceptance from middle adolescent female peers, females reported greater well-being than males. Adolescents with high expectations for being liked by peers felt better after being accepted versus rejected relative to those with low expectations. For adolescents with low expectations, acceptance and rejection were associated with similar levels of well-being. Adolescents' emotional responses to peer evaluation are influenced by specific individual characteristics and antecedent preparation for evaluation that may serve an emotion regulatory purpose.},

Two-hundred and three adolescents (M age=13.3years) completed measures of negative emotionality, emotion regulation, and socioemotional behavior. Cluster analysis suggested four profiles of adolescents: those moderate on regulation and negative emotionality, those low in both, those high in negative emotionality and low in regulation, those low in negative emotionality and high in regulation.

Results can be linked to the competency and resiliency models. Protective domains promoted greater child selfregulation, with parenting protective factors promoting greater self-regulation than child and community protection. Maternal risk had the greatest negative effect on child selfworth. Results also revealed that protective factors moderate the relationship between risk factors and child outcomes. The association between risk factors and self-regulation was low when protection was high and was significant when protection was low. Furthermore, protective factors seem to insulate boys in high-risk settings more than girls in similar environments. These findings highlight the important role of protective factors in promoting successful development of Black children reared in economically stressed rural, single-parent families and the extent to which protective factors insulate and buffer risk factors that might otherwise compromise these children's development.},

Mother-infant dyads (N = 225) were observed interacting during episodes from play, teaching, and still-face situations that varied along 2 developmentally salient dimensions: emotional challenge (low vs. high), and attentional focus (face-to-face vs. object). Attentional focus affected mothers' behavior, whereas both challenge and attentional focus affected infants. Associations between mother and infant behaviors varied in each situation. High-challenge situations provided more consistent individual differences in infants and more negative behavior from mothers.

We then offer a reciprocal and recursive lifespan meta-model that considers the interaction of ethnicity and SES history as impacting exposure to psychosocial adversities, including ethnicity-related stresses, and mediating biopsychosocial mechanisms that interact to result in hypothesized cumulative biopsychosocial vulnerabilities. Ultimately, group differences in the burden of cumulative vulnerabilities are hypothesized as contributing to differential health status over time. Suggestions are offered for future research on the unique role that ethnicity- and SES-related processes are likely to play as contributors to persistent ethnic health disparities.},

The aim of this six-year longitudinal study was to further examine associations between SAD symptoms and cannabis use over time in adolescents from the general population, specifically focusing on the potential role that adolescents' involvement with their peers may have in these associations. Participants were 497 Dutch adolescents (57 \% boys; Mage = 13.03 at T1), who completed annual self-report questionnaires for 6 successive years. Cross-lagged panel analysis suggested that adolescent SAD symptoms were associated with less peer involvement 1 year later. Less adolescent peer involvement was in turn associated with lower probabilities of cannabis use as well as lower frequency of cannabis use 1 year later. Most importantly, results suggested significant longitudinal indirect paths from adolescent SAD symptoms to cannabis use via adolescents' peer involvement. Overall, these results provide support for a protective function of SAD symptoms in association with cannabis use in adolescents from the general population. This association is partially explained by less peer involvement (suggesting increased social isolation) for those adolescents with higher levels of SAD symptoms. Future research should aim to gain more insight into the exact nature of the relationship between anxiety and cannabis use in adolescents from the general population, especially regarding potential risk and protective processes that may explain this relationship.

Confirmatory factor analysis suggested a similar factor structure in the adolescent sample of the authors as demonstrated previously among adults. Furthermore, results indicated no gender bias in ratings of DERS factors on three scales (as evidenced by strong factorial gender invariance) and limited gender bias on the other three scales (as evidenced by metric invariance). Female adolescents scored higher on four of six DERS factors than male adolescents. DERS factors were meaningfully related to adolescents' externalizing and internalizing problems. Results suggest that scores on the DERS show promising internal consistency and validity in a community sample of adolescents.},

In this paper, we first provide a literature review on the parameters' influence on the prediction performance and on variable importance measures. It is well known that in most cases RF works reasonably well with the default values of the hyperparameters specified in software packages. Nevertheless, tuning the hyperparameters can improve the performance of RF. In the second part of this paper, after a brief overview of tuning strategies we demonstrate the application of one of the most established tuning strategies, model-based optimization (MBO). To make it easier to use, we provide the tuneRanger R package that tunes RF with MBO automatically. In a benchmark study on several datasets, we compare the prediction performance and runtime of tuneRanger with other tuning implementations in R and RF with default hyperparameters.},

  abstract = {The role of emotion regulation in subclinical symptoms of mental disorders in adolescence is not yet well understood. This meta-analytic review examines the relationship between the habitual use of prominent adaptive emotion regulation strategies (cognitive reappraisal, problem solving, and acceptance) and maladaptive emotion regulation strategies (avoidance, suppression, and rumination) with depressive and anxiety symptoms in adolescence. Analyzing 68 effect sizes from 35 studies, we calculated overall outcomes across depressive and anxiety symptoms as well as psychopathology-specific outcomes. Age was examined as a continuous moderator via meta-regression models. The results from random effects analyses revealed that the habitual use of all emotion regulation strategies was significantly related to depressive and anxiety symptoms overall, with the adaptive emotion regulation strategies showing negative associations (i.e., less symptoms) with depressive and anxiety symptoms whereas the maladaptive emotion regulation strategies showed positive associations (i.e., more symptoms). A less frequent use of adaptive and a more frequent use of maladaptive emotion regulation strategies were associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms comparably in the respective directions. Regarding the psychopathology-specific outcomes, depressive and anxiety symptoms displayed similar patterns across emotion regulation strategies showing the strongest negative associations with acceptance, and strongest positive associations with avoidance and rumination. The findings underscore the relevance of adaptive and also maladaptive emotion regulation strategies in depressive and anxiety symptoms in youth, and highlight the need to further investigate the patterns of emotion regulation as a potential transdiagnostic factor.},

  abstract = {Recursive partitioning methods have become popular and widely used tools for nonparametric regression and classification in many scientific fields. Especially random forests, which can deal with large numbers of predictor variables even in the presence of complex interactions, have been applied successfully in genetics, clinical medicine, and bioinformatics within the past few years. High-dimensional problems are common not only in genetics, but also in some areas of psychological research, where only a few subjects can be measured because of time or cost constraints, yet a large amount of data is generated for each subject. Random forests have been shown to achieve a high prediction accuracy in such applications and to provide descriptive variable importance measures reflecting the impact of each variable in both main effects and interactions. The aim of this work is to introduce the principles of the standard recursive partitioning methods as well as recent methodological improvements, to illustrate their usage for low and high-dimensional data exploration, but also to point out limitations of the methods and potential pitfalls in their practical application. Application of the methods is illustrated with freely available implementations in the R system for statistical computing.},

Simulation results show that, compared with latent growth curve mixture models, SEM trees might be very sensitive to model misspecification in estimating the number of classes. This can be attributed to the lower statistical power in identifying classes, resulting from smaller differences of parameters prescribed by the template model between classes.},

Despite widespread use of risk assessment instruments in child welfare, it is unknown how well these instruments predict maltreatment and what instrument characteristics are associated with higher levels of predictive validity. Therefore, a multilevel meta-analysis was conducted to examine the predictive accuracy of (characteristics of) risk assessment instruments. A literature search yielded 30 independent studies (N=87,329) examining the predictive validity of 27 different risk assessment instruments. From these studies, 67 effect sizes could be extracted. Overall, a medium significant effect was found (AUC=0.681), indicating a moderate predictive accuracy. Moderator analyses revealed that onset of maltreatment can be better predicted than recurrence of maltreatment, which is a promising finding for early detection and prevention of child maltreatment. In addition, actuarial instruments were found to outperform clinical instruments. To bring risk and needs assessment in child welfare to a higher level, actuarial instruments should be further developed and strengthened by distinguishing risk assessment from needs assessment and by integrating risk assessment with case management.},

The aim of this study was to examine the predictive validity of a structured clinical judgement instrument \textendash{} the Check List of Child Safety (CLCS) \textendash{} that is widely used in the Netherlands. The second aim was to examine the predictive validity of a newly developed actuarial risk classification that is based on variables measured with the CLCS. Method The sample consisted of 3963 Dutch families who were under the supervision of the Dutch Child Welfare Agency (CWA) between 2011 and 2013 because of problematic child-rearing situations. Relapse was defined as restarting treatment by the CWA because of newly substantiated problematic child-rearing situations. The actuarial risk classification was developed by means of a CHAID analysis. The predictive validity of the CLCS and the actuarial risk classification were examined by calculating several performance indicators (sensitivity, specificity, false positives, false negatives and AUC values). Results The predictive validity of the CLCS was poor, with a non-significant AUC of .530, meaning that the CLCS performed no better than chance. The predictive validity of the actuarial risk classification was moderate, with a significant AUC of .630. Conclusion The actuarial risk classification not only outperformed the CLCS, but is also time-saving in practice since it comprises only variables that are significantly related to relapse.},

At this time, however, many (developmental) psychological theories are insufficiently precise to derive testable hypotheses. This limits the advancement of our principled understanding of development. This problem cannot be resolved by improving the way deductive (confirmatory) research is conducted (e.g., through preregistration and replication), because theory formation requires inductive (exploratory) research. This paper argues that machine learning can help advance theory formation in (developmental) psychology, because it enables rigorous exploration of patterns in data. The paper discusses specific advantages of machine learning, explains core methodological concepts, introduces relevant methods, and describes how data-driven insights are consolidated into theory. Machine learning automates exploration, and incorporates checks and balances to ensure generalizable results. It can assist in phenomenon detection and offers a more holistic understanding of the phenomena associated with an outcome or process of interest.},

One question in particular stands out in the current debate. Is first-person narrative more or less conducive to empathy and trust for the protagonist than third-person, internally focalized narrative? This essay tackles this question by examining the effect of narrative perspective on readers' responses to a complex, and potentially unreliable, character. To this end, we conducted an experimental study with 76 Dutch high-school students. Contrary to our predictions, the manipulation of narrative perspective did not affect empathy for the character, but did affect trust. We suggest that the increase in trust in third-person narrative depends on the external narrator's authority, which validates the perspective of the protagonist. The essay discusses these and other findings, combining experimental research with a qualitative analysis of readers' comments on the character.},

Although substantial empirical research has addressed this topic, the literature is fragmented across subdisciplines, and an overarching theoretical framework is lacking. The first step toward constructing a unifying framework is identifying relevant phenomena. This systematic review of 6305 articles used text mining to identify phenomena relevant to adolescents' emotion regulation. First, a baseline was established of relevant phenomena discussed in theory and recent narrative reviews. Then, article keywords and abstracts were analyzed using text mining, examining term frequency as an indicator of relevance and term co-occurrence as an indicator of association. The results reflected themes commonly featured in theory and narrative reviews, such as socialization and neurocognitive development, but also identified undertheorized themes, such as developmental disorders, physical health, external stressors, structural disadvantage, substance use, identity and moral development, and sexual development. The findings illustrate how text mining systematic reviews, a novel approach, may complement narrative reviews. Future theoretical work might integrate these undertheorized themes into an overarching framework, and empirical research might consider them as promising areas for future research, or as potential confounders in research on adolescents' emotion regulation.},

  abstract = {Meta-analyses in psychology often lack the power to adequately account for between-studies heterogeneity. The number of studies on any topic is typically low, because research is cost- and time-intensive. At the same time, a host of potential moderators are introduced when similar research questions are examined in different labs, sampling from different populations, using idiosyncratic methods and instrumentation. Such between-studies heterogeneity presents a substantial challenge to data aggregation in classic meta-analysis. When the causes for heterogeneity are known a-priori, they can be accounted for using meta-regression. What is currently lacking, however, is an exploratory approach, to be used when heterogeneity is suspected, but it is not known which moderators most strongly influence the observed effect size. Recently, weighted regression trees have been used to explore heterogeneity in meta-analysis. Although this provides a promising first step, single trees have many limitations, which can be overcome by using random forests: A powerful learning algorithm, which is flexible, yet relatively robust to overfitting. The present paper introduces MetaForest: An adaptation of random forests for meta-analysis. We present two simulation studies, which illustrate that, in datasets as small as 20 cases, MetaForest outperforms single trees, in terms of three metrics: 1) Predictive performance; 2) power, as evidenced by the proportion of datasets in which the algorithm achieved a positive R2cv; and 3) the ability to distinguish relevant moderators from irrelevant moderators, using variable importance measures. We discuss how MetaForest can enhance the exploration of between-studies heterogeneity when conducting meta-analyses in diverse bodies of literature.      Hosted on the Open Science Framework},

In spite of its popularity, the notion of culture within the macrosystem, as a separate entity of everyday practices and therefore microsystems, is problematic. Using the theoretical and empirical work of Rogoff and Weisner, and influenced as they are by Vygotsky?s sociocultural perspective, we reconceptualize Bronfenbrenner?s model by placing culture as an intricate part of proximal development processes. In our model, culture has the role of defining and organizing microsystems and therefore becomes part of the central processes of human development. Culture is an ever changing system composed of the daily practices of social communities (families, schools, neighborhoods, etc.) and the interpretation of those practices through language and communication. It also comprises tools and signs that are part of the historical legacy of those communities, and thus diversity is an integral part of the child?s microsystems, leading to culturally defined acceptable developmental processes and outcomes.},

  abstract = {This chapter considers the role of emotion regulation with regards to vulnerability to substance use disorders in adolescence. While a number of young people only experiment at low levels with tobacco, alcohol, or other substances in early adolescence, a proportion of these escalate their frequency and intensity of use over time. In later adolescence, frequent substance users are more likely to transition to substance use disorder, though a sizable proportion do not. Emotion regulation processes are implicated in the likelihood of transitioning from frequent use to the development of a disorder. Yet, while theoretical papers have outlined conceptual approaches to understanding how emotion regulation relates to risk for substance abuse, there is still little direct evidence on this question from adolescents. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a conceptual approach to understanding how emotion regulation is involved in vulnerability vs. protection for adolescent substance abuse. It is important to emphasize that many questions about the relation of emotion and substance use are not settled at this time. For example, it remains unclear how emotional distress is causally related to disorder, how negative affect and substance use are related in daily life, and how the physical effects of substances may contribute to the dysregulation of emotion. These topics will be illuminated by discussing current questions about emotion and its regulation and then showing how these are relevant for clinical research and practice with adolescents. An initial review of the data will highlight the prevalence of tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana use among adolescents, summarize the prevalence of substance use disorders in late adolescence, and discuss clinical issues in diagnosing these disorders in the adolescence populace. Once prevalence rates have been addressed, the emotion regulation processes relevant for substance use disorders will be discussed and reviewed. Clinical implications will be outlined, with a focus on a preventive intervention based on emotion regulation concepts that has demonstrated efficacy in reducing substance abuse issues. Finally, the current state of the area will be summarized and directions for future research will be discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Most theories and hypotheses in psychology are verbal in nature, yet their evaluation overwhelmingly relies on inferential statistical procedures. The validity of the move from qualitative to quantitative analysis depends on the verbal and statistical expressions of a hypothesis being closely aligned\textemdash that is, that the two must refer to roughly the same set of hypothetical observations. Here I argue that most inferential statistical tests in psychology fail to meet this basic condition. I demonstrate how foundational assumptions of the "random effects" model used pervasively in psychology impose far stronger constraints on the generalizability of results than most researchers appreciate. Ignoring these constraints dramatically inflates false positive rates and routinely leads researchers to draw sweeping verbal generalizations that lack any meaningful connection to the statistical quantities they are putatively based on. I argue that the routine failure to consider the generalizability of one's conclusions from a statistical perspective lies at the root of many of psychology's ongoing problems (e.g., the replication crisis), and conclude with a discussion of several potential avenues for improvement.}

  abstract = {To examine the contributions of maternal and paternal age on offspring externalizing and internalizing problems, this study analyzed problem behaviors at age 10\textendash 12 years from four Dutch population-based cohorts (N = 32,892) by a multiple informant design. Bayesian evidence synthesis was used to combine results across cohorts with 50\% of the data analyzed for discovery and 50\% for confirmation. There was evidence of a robust negative linear relation between parental age and externalizing problems as reported by parents. In teacher-reports, this relation was largely explained by parental socio-economic status. Parental age had limited to no association with internalizing problems. Thus, in this large population-based study, either a beneficial or no effect of advanced parenthood on child problem behavior was observed.},
